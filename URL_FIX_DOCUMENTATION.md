# URL Fix Documentation

## Problem

The links sent to the Telegram bot were not working correctly. The URLs were either:

- Generic base URLs (e.g., https://www.coindesk.com) instead of specific article URLs
- Made-up or incorrect URLs generated by the AI
- Missing or empty URLs

## Root Cause

The AI model was not properly using the actual article URLs extracted from the news sources. Instead, it was:

1. Creating its own URLs
2. Using base site URLs
3. Not matching the extracted URLs to the stories

## Solution

### Changes Made to `ai_analyzer.rb`

#### 1. Improved Prompt Instructions

- Added explicit instructions to use EXACT URLs from the fetched data
- Added a clear EXAMPLE showing correct vs incorrect URL usage
- Made it clear that URLs should be copied exactly, not generated

#### 2. Better Data Formatting

Changed the `format_news_for_prompt` method to make URLs more prominent:

```ruby
# OLD FORMAT:
Headlines:
1. Bitcoin Reaches New High
   URL: https://...

# NEW FORMAT:
üì∞ ARTICLES:
[Article 1]
TITLE: Bitcoin Reaches New High
FULL_URL: https://...
```

This makes it much clearer to the AI which URL belongs to which article.

#### 3. Critical Instructions Added

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- For source_url: Copy the EXACT "FULL_URL:" value from the articles above
- DO NOT create, modify, or shorten URLs
- DO NOT use base site URLs
- Match each story to its original article URL from the data
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Validate URL Extraction

```bash
ruby test_url_validation.rb
```

This test will:

- Fetch news from all 4 sources
- Validate that all URLs are properly formatted
- Check for empty or invalid URLs
- Generate a report: `url_validation_report.json`

Expected output:

```
Total articles found: 40-60
Valid URLs: 100%
Invalid URLs: 0%
```

### Test 2: Test AI URL Handling

```bash
ruby test_ai_urls.rb
```

This test will:

- Fetch news and extract URLs
- Send to AI for analysis
- Cross-check that AI-returned URLs match the fetched URLs
- Show which URLs the AI is using correctly/incorrectly

Expected output:

```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: All AI-returned URLs match fetched URLs!
```

### Test 3: Full System Test

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

This will run the complete bot and:

- Check output files: `ai_analysis.json` and `telegram_results.json`
- Verify URLs in the Telegram messages
- Test actual URL links in Telegram

## What to Look For

### In Telegram Messages

Each message should end with:

```
üîó ŸÖŸÜÿ®ÿπ ÿÆÿ®ÿ±
```

Click this link and verify:

1. ‚úÖ The link opens in browser
2. ‚úÖ It goes to a specific article (not homepage)
3. ‚úÖ The article matches the title/content in the message

### In Debug Files

#### `url_validation_report.json`

Check:

- `summary.valid_urls` should be close to `summary.total_articles`
- `errors` array should be empty or minimal

#### `debug_ai_result.json`

Check each message object:

```json
{
  "title": "ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å...",
  "body": "ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å...",
  "source_url": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/..."
}
```

The `source_url` should:

- ‚úÖ Start with https://
- ‚úÖ Be a full article URL (not just domain)
- ‚úÖ Match one of the URLs from the fetched headlines

## Troubleshooting

### If URLs are still incorrect:

1. **Check the AI model's behavior**

   ```bash
   ruby test_ai_urls.rb
   ```

   Look at the "CROSS-CHECK RESULTS" section

2. **Verify news fetching is working**

   ```bash
   ruby test_url_validation.rb
   ```

   Make sure all sources are returning valid URLs

3. **Check AI prompt is being followed**
   Look at `debug_ai_result.json` and check if URLs match the pattern from fetched data

4. **Try a different AI model**
   Edit `ai_analyzer.rb` line 27:
   ```ruby
   model: 'openai/gpt-4' # or another model
   ```

### If specific sources have issues:

- **CoinDesk**: Uses `extract_coindesk_articles` - extracts from meta tags
- **Cointelegraph**: Uses `extract_cointelegraph_articles` - extracts from link tags
- **The Block & Bitcoin Magazine**: Use `extract_generic_headlines` - extracts from anchor tags

You can test individual sources:

```bash
ruby test_coindesk.rb
ruby test_cointelegraph.rb
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Run `ruby test_url_validation.rb` - All URLs valid
- [ ] Run `ruby test_ai_urls.rb` - URLs match after AI processing
- [ ] Run `ruby main.rb` - Bot completes successfully
- [ ] Check Telegram channel - Messages received
- [ ] Click URL links in Telegram - They open correct articles
- [ ] Verify 3-5 different article links work correctly

## Notes

- The AI model quality matters - better models follow instructions more accurately
- If using a free/cheap model, URL accuracy may vary
- The prompt is now very explicit, which should help most models
- The URL extraction from news sites is working correctly (separate from AI issue)
