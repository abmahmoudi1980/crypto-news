# CoinDesk URL Extraction Fix

## Problem

CoinDesk website structure changed, and article URLs were not being extracted correctly. The article links are stored in meta tags:

```html
<meta
  name="page_url"
  content="/markets/2025/10/06/xrp-doge-sol-see-profit-taking-but-bitcoin-s-new-lifetime-high-maybe-isn-t-the-top"
/>
```

## Solution

Updated `news_fetcher.rb` with special handling for CoinDesk:

### Changes Made

1. **Added CoinDesk-specific extraction** (`extract_coindesk_articles`)

   - Extracts URLs from `<meta name="page_url">` tags
   - Finds associated titles from nearby elements
   - Builds full URLs from relative paths

2. **Improved generic headline extraction** (`extract_generic_headlines`)

   - Better selector targeting
   - Filters out navigation/footer links
   - More robust URL extraction

3. **Smart extraction logic**
   - Detects CoinDesk domain and uses specialized method
   - Falls back to generic method for other sites
   - Removes duplicate URLs

## How It Works

```ruby
# For CoinDesk
doc.css('meta[name="page_url"]').each do |meta|
  page_url = meta['content']  # e.g., "/markets/2025/10/06/article-slug"
  full_url = normalize_url(page_url, base_url)  # → https://www.coindesk.com/markets/...
  # Find title and add to results
end
```

## Testing

### Test CoinDesk Fetching

```bash
# Run the test script
ruby test_coindesk.rb
```

This will:

- Fetch the CoinDesk homepage
- Extract article headlines and URLs
- Display results with validation
- Save output to `test_coindesk_output.json`

Expected output:

```
Testing CoinDesk News Fetching

Fetching from CoinDesk...
✓ Fetched successfully!

Found 15 headlines:

[1] XRP, DOGE, SOL See Profit Taking But Bitcoin's New Lifetime High Maybe Isn't the Top
    URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/06/xrp-doge-sol-see-profit-taking...
    ✓ Valid CoinDesk URL

[2] Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High Above $73,000

    ✓ Valid CoinDesk URL

```

### Test Full Bot

```bash
# Test locally (without Docker)
ruby main.rb

# Check output/fetched_news.json
cat output/fetched_news.json | grep -A 5 coindesk
```

### Test in Docker

```bash
# Rebuild with the fix
docker compose build --no-cache

# Run once
docker compose run --rm crypto-news-bot

# Check logs
docker compose logs
```

## Validation

The fix ensures:

- ✅ Extracts URLs from meta tags on CoinDesk
- ✅ Builds complete URLs (https://www.coindesk.com/...)
- ✅ Finds article titles correctly
- ✅ Removes duplicates
- ✅ Works for other news sites too

## Other News Sources

The generic extraction method handles:

- **Cointelegraph** - Standard article links
- **The Block** - Article cards and links
- **Bitcoin Magazine** - Blog post links

## Troubleshooting

### No headlines found for CoinDesk

1. Check if the site structure changed:

```bash
curl -s https://www.coindesk.com | grep 'meta name="page_url"'
```

2. Run test script with debug:

```bash
ruby test_coindesk.rb
cat test_coindesk_output.json
```

3. Check the sample HTML in output file

### URLs are incomplete

The `normalize_url` method should handle:

- Relative URLs: `/markets/2025/...` → Full URL
- Protocol-relative: `//example.com/...` → `https://...`
- Already complete: `https://...` → No change

### Still getting errors

1. Check User-Agent header (some sites block bots)
2. Check for rate limiting (429 errors)
3. Try with a browser to confirm site is accessible

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `news_fetcher.rb` - Main fix

   - Added `extract_coindesk_articles` method
   - Added `extract_generic_headlines` method
   - Updated `extract_headlines` with smart routing

2. ✅ `test_coindesk.rb` - Test script

## Apply the Fix

### Local Development

```bash
# Test the fix
ruby test_coindesk.rb

# Run the bot
ruby main.rb
```

### Docker Production

```bash
# Rebuild image with the fix
docker compose build --no-cache

# Run
docker compose up

# Or if using timer
sudo cp crypto-news-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart crypto-news-bot.timer
```

## Verify It's Working

Check the logs for:

```
Fetching from coindesk...
✓ Found 15 headlines from coindesk
```

Or check output:

```bash
# Local
cat output/fetched_news.json | jq '.coindesk.content.headlines'

# Docker
docker exec crypto-news-bot cat /app/output/fetched_news.json | jq '.coindesk.content.headlines'
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: CoinDesk article URLs now extracted correctly from meta tags
✅ **Tested**: Test script included
✅ **Compatible**: Works with other news sources
✅ **Robust**: Falls back to generic extraction if needed

The bot will now correctly identify and send CoinDesk articles!
